## BusyBox for SailFish OS

The busybox .config and RPM .spec for SailFish OS

### Rationale

This fork is focused in producing a fully feature static busybox and the dynamic has been kept, just in case.

Both .config files has been modified for this aim and aligned as much as possible. 

The original configs has been kept for reference.

> Only the statically linked busybox uses preferably its applets. This changes the behaviour of your system because even if the `PATH`

> the system would continue to use the installed binaries: a busybox with many applets without their links.

> Fortunately the RPM build failed and log out all the links created but not expected. Those links has been added in a single RPM
> package named `symlinks-others` which brings within it `Provides: deprecated()` and `Conflicts: busybox` limitations that hopefully
> will prevent anyone to install it by an accident. Unless `--force` is used by default but in such case they deserve it.

### Conclusion

This fork is for SFOS refactoring and it should be employed within this specific framework, only. 

If you like to play with and/or learning about embedded systems on mobile devices, you are welcome into the club.

If you brick your mobile device and you fear to loose your precious data because you never did a backup of them, wait before crying. 
You will be not left behind: you also will be welcomed, as ðŸ’²upporter of the club :wink:.
